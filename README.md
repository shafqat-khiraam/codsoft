CodSoft Projects

This repository contains three projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. These projects showcase my work in various domains, including chatbot development, a Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI, and a movie recommendation system.

Projects

1. VIS Chatbot  
A simple Python-based chatbot named VIS (Very Intelligent System) that interacts with users through pattern matching. It can respond to greetings, tell jokes and riddles, and provide various information like weather, time, and more.

2. Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI  
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player ('X') competes against an AI opponent ('O'). The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move.

Features:  
- 2-player game: Human ('X') vs AI ('O').  
- AI plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.  
- Announces the winner or declares a draw when the game ends.

Usage:  
- The human player enters their move (1-9) to place their 'X'.  
- The AI automatically calculates and places its 'O'.  
- The game continues until thereâ€™s a winner or the game ends in a draw.
